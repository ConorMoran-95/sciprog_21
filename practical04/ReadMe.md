In this practical we will build upon the work from last week. We will do this by creating additional program blocks. We will calculate the values of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range 0 to 60 every five degrees. We will place the results in an array, print the array & make the array a global variable.

Run the following lines of code to compile and run the two c scripts provided:

gcc trapezodial_v2.c -o trapezodial_v2 -lm  
./trapezodial_v2  

gcc trapezodial_v3.c -o trapezodial_v3 -lm  
./trapezodial_v3
