There are three scripts uploaded here which are required to successfully complete this practical.

Namely, these are Arctan.c, fibo.c and scanf.c.

To Compile these scripts, you can run gcc followed by the c script name. Arctan.c also requires -lm to be attached at the end of its compilation command so that we can use the mathematical tools within.
