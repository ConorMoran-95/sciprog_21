For the final practical, we will take a look at the tower of hanoi puzzle. We will write a function that prints on screen the sequence of moves required to solve the puzzle for any given number n.

To complete this practical, all you have to do is compile and run the provided script:

gcc hanoi.c
./a.out

You will then be asked to enter the number of disks you desire to work with, e.g. 3. Then the code will run and results will be printed to the display.
