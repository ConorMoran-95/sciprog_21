The focus for the code provided in this practical is recursive functions. We have written a function that returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a pair of integers passed as arguments.

This is a very straightforward script to run. All that we have to do is compile it and input two positive integers. 

The following will compile and run the code:

gcc gcd.c
./a.out
