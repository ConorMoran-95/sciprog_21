Two files have been uploaded for the completion of practical09.

Both of these files can be compiled and ran as follows:

gcc main.c 
./a.out

gcc magic_sq_file.c 
./a.out

The magic_sq_input.c will ask for the value you wish each element in the matrix to have, meanwhile the magic_sq_file.c will ask for an input text file which includes only a matrix. Think of something as below to be an appropriate example:

2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8

Both of these files make use of the provided magic_square.h file.
